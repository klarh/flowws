# Introduction

`flowws` is an in-development framework for building modular, reusable
task workflows. The core library contains tools to abstract over
storage locations and parse arguments in a uniform way for both python
scripts and command-line-based execution. It is designed to help solve
the following problems:

- Composing tasks from a series of modular actions
- Parameterizing tasks and exposing interfaces for both interactive and batch execution
- Improving reproducibility by encapsulating parameters within workflow definitions

`flowws` is being developed in conjunction with other projects, including:

- [hoomd-flowws](https://github.com/klarh/hoomd_flowws): perform simulations with [hoomd-blue](https://github.com/glotzerlab/hoomd-blue).
- [flowws-analysis](https://github.com/klarh/flowws-analysis): run analysis and visualization workflows
- [flowws-freud](https://github.com/klarh/flowws-freud): molecular simulation-specific modules for `flowws-analysis`
- [flowws-examples](http://github.com/klarh/flowws-examples): example workflows using the above projects

## Installation

Install flowws from PyPI:

```
pip install flowws
```

Alternatively, install from source:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/klarh/flowws.git#egg=flowws
```

## Examples

The [flowws-examples](http://github.com/klarh/flowws-examples) project
contains interactive notebook examples that demonstrate various
workflows.
